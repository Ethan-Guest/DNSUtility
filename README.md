# DNS Utility 
### By Ethan Guest

DNS Utility collects a list of publicly available nameservers and tests your connection to each one. The test results are ranked, with information such as reliabiity, security, and average ping available. You can then apply preferred and alternate nameservers to your NIC directly from the application.
